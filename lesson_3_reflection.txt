When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    cloud

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I can specitfy which branch and when should I do the sync

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branch is different commit tree. clone is to copy the whole files with the commits. Fork is github version of clone.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you can decide if you want to merge the newest change on the cloud to the local

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I will only do changes in other branch and create a pull request make others easy to merge it

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    It's easy to cooperate with others and create quality code
